CHOOSING PUNCTUATION:

If sentence starts with an interogative word, should we hard-code a question mark at the end?
Example: We have a sentence starting with the word "what" or "who" or "when," there's a very
high probability that that sentence would be a question.

Proposition: two models -- one model for the text generation, another for punctuation placement
and choice of punctuation.

Proposition: Capitalize the first word in every sentence, force lowercase for all other words,
except for words listed as proper nouns or names in a hard-coded database which we maintain.
Alternatively, have the parser take note of when a word is capitalized?
