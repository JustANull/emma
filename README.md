            ELECTRONIC MODEL of MAPPED ASSOCIATIONS

          Written by Ellie Cochran & Alexander Howard

Emma is a computer program that generates rough concepts of associations by reading input. She uses these associations, in conjunction with learned sentence structure patterns, to generate a reply (consequently, Emma is *not* a run-of-the-mill Markov bot. She's much more interesting than that~). She is a Summer project created by Digital Media student, programmer, & computer artist Ellie Cochran, and Computer Science & Mathematics student Alexander Howard.
