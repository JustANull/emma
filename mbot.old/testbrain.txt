the wheels on the bus go round and round
round and round
round and round
the wheels on the bus go round and round
all through the town
twinkle twinkle little star
how i wonder what you are
up above the word so high
like a diamond in the sky
this is the song that never ends
it just keeps going on, my friend
someone started singing it
not knowing what it was
and they will keep on singing it
forever just because
